### What I learned

I've used the new nextJs @next/font(beta) component which optimizes the fonts (including custom fonts) and remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance. see: [Optimizing Fonts](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/optimizing/fonts) to learn more.

### Continued development

Implement a version that permits to two users to play against each other online.
